# RetirePy
401k/IRA Growth Calculator

For now this is just a project built around compounding interest within a specified period.

Usage:
---
```python
 python invest.py
 ```
>Will prompt you at command line to input starting amount, regular payments, and expected APR
```python
from invest import Invest
```
>Can be used as a library for other scripts/apps, such as a matplotlib generator (one is included), or (this is in my own future plans for this repo) something like a web-app where you can add increases to your monthly payments at set intervals, such as increasing your contributions every 5 years in expectaction of salary increases etc.
